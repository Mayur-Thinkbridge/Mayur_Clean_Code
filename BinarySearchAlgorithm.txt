1. Start with a sorted array and a target value.
2. Initialize the left and right boundaries of the search range. Set left = 0 and right = array.length - 1.
3. Repeat steps 4-9 while left <= right.
4. Calculate the middle index of the search range. Set mid = left + (right - left) / 2.
5. Check if the target value is equal to the element at the middle index: 
   - If they are equal, return the middle index as the result.
6. Check if the target value is greater than the element at the middle index:
   - If it is greater, update the left boundary to mid + 1.
7. If the target value is smaller than the element at the middle index:
   - If it is smaller, update the right boundary to mid - 1.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the target value is found or the search range is exhausted.
9. If the search range is exhausted (left > right), return -1 to indicate that the target value was not found in the array.
10. End the algorithm.
